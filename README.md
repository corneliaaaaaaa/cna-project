# cna-project
Final project of Computer Networks and Applications at NTU by amber, erica, jtc, daphne, wsa

## About This Project
This is a 2 Player Online Minesweeper. You can either create an empty room and invite your friend, enter a random room, or join a specific room that your friend has created. Players take turns to either take a step or place a flag. In addition to original features of Minesweeper, we add timer into our game, to make the competition more thrilled. Enjoy the match!
